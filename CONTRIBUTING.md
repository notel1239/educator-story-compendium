# Contributing to the Educator's Story Compendium

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will walk you through the process of sharing a classroom story. We’ve designed a simple two‑step workflow that ensures every story is well‑structured, reviewed constructively, and added to the compendium in a way that benefits the entire community.

## Overview: The Story Contribution Workflow

1.  **Step 1 – Propose a Story (Issue)**  
    Before writing a full story, please open a GitHub Issue to propose your idea. This lets the community discuss the focus, avoid duplicates, and give early feedback.

2.  **Step 2 – Submit the Story (Pull Request)**  
    Once your proposal is acknowledged, you’ll write the complete story using our template and submit it as a Pull Request. The PR will be reviewed, and after any suggested refinements, it will be merged into the compendium.

## Step 1: Propose a Story (Issue)

### How to Create a Story Proposal

1.  Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/notel1239/educator-story-compendium/issues) and click **New issue**.
2.  Use the following template in the issue body (you can copy and paste it):

    ```markdown
    ## Proposed Title
    (A concise, descriptive title for your story)

    ## The Challenge
    (Briefly describe the classroom situation or problem you faced. What made this moment significant?)

    ## The Core Lesson
    (What is the main insight or teaching strategy you want to share with other educators?)
    ```

3.  Add any relevant labels (e.g., `grade-level`, `subject-area`) if you wish, though this is optional.
4.  Submit the issue.

A maintainer or community member will acknowledge your proposal within a few days. You may receive questions or suggestions to help shape the full story.

## Step 2: Submit the Story (Pull Request)

### Preparing Your Story

1.  **Fork the repository** (if you haven’t already) and clone your fork locally.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your story, e.g., `story/unfocused-student`.
3.  **Create a new markdown file** inside the `stories/` folder.  
    Name it using kebab‑case and a descriptive title, e.g., `the-unfocused-student.md`.
4.  **Copy the content** of [`stories/TEMPLATE.md`](stories/TEMPLATE.md) into your new file.
5.  **Fill in the template** with your complete narrative. Be as detailed as you feel comfortable, while respecting student privacy (use pseudonyms, avoid identifiable details).

### Opening the Pull Request

1.  Commit your changes and push your branch to your fork.
2.  Go to the original repository and open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch.
3.  In the PR title, reference the issue number you created in Step 1. Example:  
    `Add story about The Unfocused Student (resolves #1)`
4.  In the PR description, briefly summarize what your story covers and note any questions you’d like reviewers to focus on.

### The Review Process

*   One or more community members will read your story and offer feedback.
*   Feedback will focus on clarity, structure, and educational value—never on judging your teaching.
*   You may be asked to make small edits or clarifications. Please respond to the comments and update your PR accordingly.
*   Once the reviewers are satisfied, your PR will be merged and your story will become part of the compendium.

## Guidelines for Storytellers

*   **Respect privacy:** Never use real names of students, colleagues, or schools. Use pseudonyms or generic descriptors (e.g., “a fifth‑grade student,” “my co‑teacher”).
*   **Focus on learning:** The goal is to extract a concrete lesson that other educators can adapt or reflect upon.
*   **Be honest:** Stories don’t need to have a perfect ending. Sometimes the most valuable lessons come from moments of struggle or uncertainty.
*   **Keep it constructive:** When commenting on others’ stories, frame feedback as suggestions for clarity or expansion, not criticism of the teaching described.
